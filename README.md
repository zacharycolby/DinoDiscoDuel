ReadMe for DinoDiscoDuel

Hello! Here is a brief README for my game!

As the game opens, click start to play! Then use corresponding arrow keys as they line up with their respective color block.
Once it starts, it goes for a set amount of arrows, so wait until then or play until then, then you can go back to title screen!
When at the title screen, you can play again or you can exit! Exiting doesn't seem to work on the Unity website through the
    button however, so only use that when using the .exe or app file!

If any issues arise with the files, the game can always be accessed through this link:
